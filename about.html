    <hr>

    <p>
        I'm Pulkit Chaudhary — a Computer Science undergraduate passionate about writing great software.
        I have experience in HTML, CSS, C++, and enjoy turning ideas into working projects.
        I'm always looking to grow, collaborate, and contribute to meaningful work.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">
        I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can learn quickly and build things that matter.
        I am actively seeking internship opportunities to apply my skills in a real-world setting
        and grow as a developer.
